beaconHunt -

an application to locate advertising beacons as part of a scavanger hunt.  Currently,
all beacons are hard coded.  A second app will be used to create/modify personalized
scavanger hunts which will be made available at the startup screen via login/lists.
For now, customizations can be made via the mySql database.

Image naming convention -

Hint Name in database:          imageName
Hint Name in images folder      imageName.jpg           160x160 (scaled to 80x80 in<li> full size in clue lists)
                                imageName_revealed.jpg   80x80 (only displayed in <li>, larger files will be reduced)
